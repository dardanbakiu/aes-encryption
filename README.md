aes-encrypted broadcast chat

Using Python and it's libraries to send AES encrypted messages
in the server and when recieving a message, decrypting it.

The key is a random 16 character string generated by the server in it's first
initialisation and it's sent to all clients that connect with it for the first time
and then it's used to encrypt and decrypt messages.

Server saves all the messages in a local file that will be easy to access
and read for learning purposes, just to have a glance how the encrypted
messages travel client-server-clients
